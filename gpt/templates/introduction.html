                    In the following pages you will be presented with a grid composed of 64 faced-down cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your task is to select any amount of cards that you wish to reveal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have to chance to earn <b>20 eurocents</b> for every card that is collected.

                <p>
                    Such earnings are only potential, however, because behind one of these cards hides <b>ONE
                    special card that makes you loose everything that has been collected.</b>
                    <br>The location of this special card is randomly determined,
                    so it can be in any place with equal probability

                <p>
                    Your task is to choose how many cards to reveal. You do so by clicking on the cards you wish to
                    reveal and hitting the button
                    <i>'Reveal Cards'</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Remember:</b><br>
                    If you happen to have revealed the special card, you will earn â‚¬0.
                    <br>Otherwise, you will earn the amount of money accumulated.
