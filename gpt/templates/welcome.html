                Welcome and thank you for considering participating in this experiment.
                <br>
                I, Lucas Bagnari de Seabra, am conducting this experiment as part of my Master Thesis at Cat√≥lica
                Lisbon School of Business and Economics, under the supervision of Prof. Filipa de Almeida.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before starting, please <strong>read the information presented below.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you agree to participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a survey.
                The survey will take approximately 7 minutes to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please answer as honestly as possible. All answers will be kept strictly confidentially and are anonymous.
                <br>
                This means that it will not be possible to link your responses to your identity.
                <br>
                The data collected will be used for research purposes only and may be presented in my thesis or
                disseminated in academic journals, always in an aggregated form, never about any individual response.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ask you to take the study in one go, without interruptions.
                <br>
                There are no expected side effects of participating in this study beyond those associated with
                looking at a computer screen for circa 7 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is the possibility of having a monetary compensation, which will be explained later.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may change your mind and drop out at any point of the study during its completion.
            </p>
            <p>
